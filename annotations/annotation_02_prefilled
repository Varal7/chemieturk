Trans addition generates a cyclobutene dialkoxide which opens quickly to yield a doubly - charged 1,3,5,7-0ctatetraene amenable to cyclization from its coiled conformation. Both events proceed conrotatorily , and information about structural effects on reactivity has begun to emerge.* In unsymmetrical cases , the resultant 1,3,5- cyclooctatrienes do not necessarily experience monoprotonation at both available enolate centers regioselectively. As a conse- quence , competing aldolization can give rise to a pair of polyquinanes.

The decrease in entropy associated with tethering the two reactive components suggests that the reaction would be significantly more facile than the intermolecular reaction.25 However , this potential rate enhancement is com- promised by the dramatic decrease in rate associated with intermolecular cycloadditions with substituted norbomadienes as described previously. There were no reported examples of successful intramolecular HDA reactions in the literature prior to 1992.5d,26 In an intramolecular reaction , there are two possible modes of [ 2n + 227 + 2271 cycloaddition which have to be considered ( Scheme 3 ). The dienophile in the tether can cyclize on Ca- Cb-CC to give a cycloadduct of type I or it can cyclize on Cd- Ce-Cf to give a type I1 cycloadduct. Molecular models and MM2 calculations indicate that both products would be stable .","17, 18, 67, 68, 115, 116, 137, 138",,,,,,,,

Crystals of [4][Br] belong to the monoclinic space group C2 / c ; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. The crystal structure consists of ribbon - like arrays of alternating [4]’+ radical cations and bromide anions strung together along two-fold axes running parallel to the y direction ; these ribbons form in-register layers in the xy plane , as shown in Figure 4. The ribbons are layered in the z direction , each layer being offset from the one above and below so that the halide ion of one layer is approximately aligned with the internal S-S bond of one of the CN & rings in the layers above and below it.

10.1021/ja00131a031-0,"Department of Chemistry and Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter , University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 Received March 27 , I995 A common goal in sensory materials is increased sensitivity , which has led to great interest in fluorescence - based chemosen- sors.' However , in spite of progress in instrumentation and materials , there is an ever increasing need for the detection of trace analytes. Increasing the association constant of the recognition ( binding ) event increases a sensory device 's sen- sitivity. Unfortunately , such an approach to enhanced sensitivity can have the disadvantage of irreversible responses or very long reset times. An additional limitation is that receptors with sufficiently high association constants may not be available. In this report we demonstrate a new method for enhancing the sensitivity of a fluorescence - based chemosensor , which may be used in conjunction with , but does not require , an increased association constant. This method makes use of the special electronic properties of conjugated polymers , which results in an amplified response due to the efficient energy migration to occupied receptor sites .",,,,,,,,,

Exposing the two reactants to 2 mol % palladium acetate and 2 mol % tris(2,6-dimeth- oxyphenyl)phosphineE(TDMPP) in THF did indeed produce 4a9 but also a second product readily identified as furan 5a9 by its spectroscopic properties. To explore what role , if any , the presence of a hydroxyl group in the donor alkyne played in facilitating furan formation and to determine the parameters to promote furan formation , we tumed to a simpler system , l b ( eq 1 ). Most revealing was the effect of the ratio of ligand to palladium salt on this process. In this case , lactonization of the initial adduct 2b to 4b appears to be quite slow and the preferred cyclization path produces the furan 5b. Treatment under the above conditions gives mostly the initial adduct as well as furan. Performing the reaction in benzene saw more conversion of the initial adduct 2b to a mixture of isofuran 3bI0 and furan 5b. To establish whether the rather basic phosphine TDMPP was promoting furan formation , its ratio relative to palladium acetate was increased. However , the net effect was a strong inhibition of cyclization of 2b. Quite the contrary , increasing the amount of palladium acetate relative to TDMPP dramatically improved the furan formation. Thus , using a 1 : 2 or preferably 2 : s TDMPP : Pd(OAc)z ratio effects complete addition and cyclization to 3b and 5b.

10.1021/ja00134a007-0,"Abstract : The two enantiomers of trans- 1,2-diaminocylohexane form well - defined supramolecular structures with appropriately paired C2 symmetrical 1,2-diols that are assembled by H-bonding. Depending on the structure and chirality of the diol , it is possible to form left- or right - handed trihelicate structures consisting of polar cores and hydrophobic outer residues. These structures can be sublimed without change , and they slowly adsorb carbon dioxide to eventually give polymeric amorphous fibers. Heating these materials regenerates the original 1 : l adducts as supramolecular entities. The parent diamines can be converted into crystalline carbamate salts which exist as layered trihelicate structures. Other charged supramolecular structures are formed from the (R,R)-diamine and the enantiomeric tartaric acids. The diamine molecule appears to be a superb assembler of neutral and charged supramolecular structures by accommodating preferred diol and acid partners in its crystal lattice. Molecular recognition and self - assembly are based on non-amidic H - bonding between amine and alcohol functions in the neutral molecules , leading to supramolecular structures whose helicity mode depends on the sense of chirality of the diamine used. All the reported structures were characterized by single - crystal X-ray analysis .","7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 33, 34, 45, 46, 90, 91, 96, 97, 102, 103, 112, 113, 119, 120, 136, 137, 158, 159, 160, 161, 182, 183",,,,,,,,

10.1021/ja00134a014-15,"Further substitution chemistry underscores the unusual prop- erties of this class of ligands. Reaction of [PPN][Rh(CO)- { P(pyrrolyl)3}3 ] with excess P(pyrrolyl)3 at elevated temperature leads to gradual CO evolution and quantitative formation of a fourth Rh - P(pyrrolyl)3 complex. The IR spectrum shows a complete loss of CO ligands. A single doublet is observed in the 31P NMR spectrum with a chemical shift and & h-p similar to those observed for the anionic Rh - P(pyrrolyl) : , complexes previously described. Consistent with the 31P spectrum , the 'H Nh4R shows only resonances due to a single pyrrolyl moiety. Integration of the 31P and 'H spectra shows that the ratio of coordinated P(pyrrolyl)3 to PPN+ is 4 : 1. Based on these data this new complex is assigned to the homoleptic phosphine anion [PPN][Rh{P(pyrrolyl)3}4]. This complex is readily isolated as crystals in 85 % yield from Et20 / THF as the THF monosolvate. Similar substitution chemistry is accomplished with the chelating ligand ( pyrrolyl ) ~ P(CH2) ~ P(pyrrolyl)2 ( Scheme 2 ).

Reaction of [PPN][Rh(CO)- { P(pyrrolyl)3}3 ] with excess P(pyrrolyl)3 at elevated temperature leads to gradual CO evolution and quantitative formation of a fourth Rh - P(pyrrolyl)3 complex. The IR spectrum shows a complete loss of CO ligands.

Consistent with the 31P spectrum , the 'H Nh4R shows only resonances due to a single pyrrolyl moiety. Integration of the 31P and 'H spectra shows that the ratio of coordinated P(pyrrolyl)3 to PPN+ is 4 : 1.

Thus , the ultimate formation of a mixture of diene geometric isomers can be understood in terms of a mechanism in which ring opening occurs in stereospecific , disrotatory fashion on the excited state surface to yield a single , electroni- cally excited diene. The overall non-stereoselectivity results from the manner in which the excited product decays to the ground state , primarily by E,Z - isomerization. In conventional terms , our results suggest that ring opening follows the excited state pathway predicted by orbital symmetry rules , but the avoided crossing for disrotatory cyclobutenelbutadiene inter- conver ~ ion ~ , ~ is bypassed to allow access to the same region of the excited state potential energy surface that is accessed predominantly when the single diene isomer is itself excited directly.

Two mutants were designed to have a histidine pair ( His- X3 - His ) on surface - exposed R-helices located in one of the two protein domains. It was first demonstrated that the mutant proteins in solution retain their full activity and that the kinetic constants of the redox catalytic steps are not affected by the mutations. The enzyme - modified gold electrodes were then analyzed for the amount and distribution of protein on their surface and for their activity using atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The two electrode - bound mutant enzymes manifested differences in the amount and distribution of bound molecules , in the kinetic constants of their redox catalytic steps , and most interestingly , in their ability to transfer electrons to a redox mediator covalently attached to the self - assembled monolayer.

Its smectic layer possessed a liquidlike association of the molecules similar to the SmA or SmC phase , although the texture that developed from the isotropic melt was unconventional. Small fractal domains initially grew and then coalesced into several large domains. Very weak birefringence and fine structure without any anisotropy are characteristic of this phase. It is interesting to note that two different domains exist showing the opposite sign of optical rotation. Strong circular dichroism ( CD ) with a peak at 430 nm was also observed for each domain with the opposite sign. The results suggest a natural occurrence of the helix in these materials. The right - handed and left - handed helices were formed with equal probabilities , but the left - handed helix was selectively formed by the introduction of a chiral dopant.

10.1021/ja001372a-0,"Chiral lithium amides have been utilized as bases in asymmetric deprotonation reactions and as chiral auxiliaries in other reactions.1 Koga and others have shown that chiral lithium amides can lead to high stereoselectivities in aldol and related reactions.2 The effect of these chiral lithium amides in aldol reactions , generally referred to as the Li - amide effect,3 is likely to arise from mixed aggregates containing both lithium enolates and lithium amides. Conse- quently , identification of these aggregates , including their struc- tural details , are important for designing and choosing chiral amines and for probing the origin of the stereoselectivity in asymmetric reactions involving these species. Previously , we isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction mixed aggregates containing Li - enolates and achiral Li - amides.4 We and others have suggested the importance of these species in enolate reactions.5 We now wish to report definitive evidence for a simple enolate , chiral lithium amide complex that we ’ve purposefully designed.

The orientation of the principal axes of the chemical shift tensor has been estimated using ab initio calculations of the tensors. The calculated shift tensors for the axial and equatorial isomers of methylcyclohexane , which are also presented in this paper , are almost identical to those from the 3,5-dimethyl-substituted compound. This indicates that chemical shift tensors for a methyl group are primarily determined by local electronic and steric factors. Changes in steric effects and p - substituent effects between axial and equatorial methyls on the cyclohexane ring are discussed in terms of their effect upon chemical shift tensors in these paraffin hydrocarbons .","15, 16, 42, 43, 76, 77, 103, 104, 127, 128, 130, 131, 146, 147",,,,,,,,

10.1021/ja00138a004-0,"Abstract : Poly(o-aminobenzylphosphonic acid ) and its sodium salts , made by progressive neutralization with NaOH , have been prepared and characterized. Both the hemisodium and monosodium salts are intrinsically self - doped and water - soluble in the conducting form. The key is to control the ionization of the excess acid functions on the polymer chains. XPS results suggest that the polymer is obtained directly in the 43 % polyzwitterionic ( Le. , self - doped ) emeraldine form. The self - doped polymer does not exhibit any conductivity dependence on pH below 6 , in marked contrast to the HC1 - doped polyanilines. Our structurally well - defined polymer system displays only one set of redox activity over the potential range of -0.2 to 1.2 eV , alluding to the higher stability of the self - doped structure. This is unique and different from other polyaniline systems which show two sets of redox peaks. FTIR spectroscopy provides evidence for strong intra-chain hydrogen bonding while NMR studies conclude that protonated and S cm- ’ ) unprotonated segments of the solvated monosodium polymer are distinct. The lower conductivity obtained is attributed to the decrease in conjugation caused by the large steric effect of the bulky PO3H2 and a significant hydrogen bond interaction between P02(0H)- and NH’+ leading to significant charge - pinning.

10.1021/ja00138a017-1,"The decarboxylation of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acids to form salicylonitriles has been investigated in extraordinary detail by Kemp et al. ’ The reaction involves the conversion of the conjugate base of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid ( 1 ) to cy- anophenoxide 3 , without formation of an intermediate ( Scheme 1 ). The reaction rate is enormously sensitive to solvent polarity. There is a 108-fold increase in rate on changing the reaction medium from polar protic ( H20 ) to polar aprotic ( hexameth- ylphosphoramide ). This has been explained by ( 1 ) stabilization of the carboxylate in protic media by hydrogen bonding , which raises the activation energy , and ( 2 ) stabilization of the charge- delocalized transition state , 2 through dispersion interactions with polarizable media. The second explanation rests on the assumption that the extended n-system is easier to polarize in the transition state than in the ground state.

It is highly selective and stereospecific and has been in wide use since the early 1960s. An unusual feature of its chemistry is that diazene is believed to react through a pericyclic transition state , with both hydrogen atoms donating across the multiple bond. In recent experimental investigations we have measured the kinetics of diimide reduction of itself in aqueous media , i.e. , its disproportionation.2 We found that the rate law , rate constant , and activation parameters were in agreement with ab initio calculations based on the following scenario : ( 1 ) trans-NzH2 is in solvent - catalyzed equilibrium with its high - energy cis isomer , and ( 2 ) the cis isomer donates both hydrogen atoms in a concerted pericyclic manner with virtually no activation enthalpy , the transition state being highly entropy controlled.

10.1021/ja00140a023-0,"Abstract : We have investigated fluorine substitution effects on the rate of coupling of adsorbed alkyl groups on a Ag(ll1) surface. Alkyl groups are formed by thermal dissociation of the C-I bond in adsorbed alkyl iodides. Variable heating rate temperature programmed reaction ( TPR ) studies were used to determine the kinetic parameters for the coupling of ethyl groups and propyl groups. They are Ea = 15.1 f 0.6 kcallmol , Y = 10'6.7*0.8 S-I and E , = 16.9 f 0.4 kcallmol , Y = 1017.1*0.4 s-l , respectively. Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen in the adsorbed alkyl groups systematically raises the coupling reaction temperature. For example , trifluoropropyl groups self - couple at temperatures -70 K higher than propyl groups on Ag( 11 1 ). Coadsorbed propyl and trifluoropropyl groups cross- couple at temperatures -10 K higher than the propyl self - coupling reaction.

The sequence involves four individual reaction steps. Three of these steps can be accelerated using general acid - base catalysis to effect proton transfer at or near the a-carbon of the ketone involved in the condensation , which is at the homobenzylic position relative to the aromatic group of the substrate ( Ar ). An antibody to the corresponding N-benzyl-N-methylpiperidinium hapten 5 was found to catalyze the entire reaction sequence. This antibody seems to act purely as a general base and does not catalyze the carbon-carbon bond forming step. Catalysis of the aldol elimination is selective for the disfavored trans- elimination with a single enantiomer of stereoisomer 2a. Catalysis is suppressed by incubating the antibody with a carboxyl-specific reagent , suggesting that a carboxyl group acts as a general base to catalyze the sequence. The antibody is approximately 2.0 x lo5 times more reactive than acetate for catalysis of the sequence. These experiments demonstrate that catalysis of reactions with several consecutive transition states is possible using catalytic antibodies .","4, 5, 7, 8, 17, 18, 49, 50, 52, 53, 80, 81, 113, 114, 144, 145, 166, 167","8,9","12,13,13,14,14,15,17,18,18,19,19,20,20,21",,"3,4,4,5,5,6",,,,

10.1021/ja00142a008-0,"Abstract : The role of local steric influences on the solution conformation and the biological activity of the H - type II blood group determinant 1 has been evaluated using structurally modified trisaccharides 2-4 and their corresponding C1 - substituted C-glycosides 5-8 as conformational models. The preference of the C-glycosidic bond to adopt the gauche “ exo-anomeric ” conformation and the removal of destabilizing 1,3-diaxial - like interactions on the C-aglyconic bond have been used to create predictable conformational characteristics in C-trisaccharides 5-8. Vicinal coupling constants from ‘ H NMR spectroscopy and 2D NOESY spectroscopy demonstrate that structural modifications in the C-trisaccharides result in large changes in their conformational preferences. To test the impact of solution conformation on receptor - ligand recognition , the affinities of compounds 1-8 toward the lectin I of Ulex europaeus ( UEA-I ) have been investigated using a quantitative binding assay. The binding affinities of the H - type 11 trisaccharide 1 and the corresponding carbon analog 5 are virtually identical. The activities of the structurally modified C-trisaccharides 6-8 decrease sharply relative to the unmodified C-trisaccharide 5 , correlating conformation to binding affinity. A parallel gradient in binding affinity is observed for the 0-trisaccharides 1-4. The selectivity of UEA-I for epitopes 1-8 validates the assumption that its receptor site largely defines a bound conformation for the substrates , and establishes that the conformational behavior of 0-glycosides such as 1-4 is similar to that of C-glycosides such as 5-8 .","32, 33, 40, 41, 70, 71, 81, 82, 101, 102, 155, 156, 160, 161, 172, 173, 180, 181, 230, 231, 239, 240",,,,,,,,

10.1021/ja00142a012-0,"Abstract : A new strategy has been devised for the construction of photoactive multicomponent arrays based on metal ion chelation whereby bisporphyrins have been assembled around a central ruthenium( @ bis(terpyridy1) complex. One of the terminal subunits is a gold(II1) porphyrin while the second terminus is selected from a gold(III) , zinc(II) , or free - base porphyrin. Photophysical properties have been measured for each of the tripartite compounds using ultrafast transient absorption and emission spectroscopy. Excitation into the central ruthenium(I1) bis(terpyridy1) complex is followed by rapid intramolecular triplet energy transfer to one of the appended porphyrins. Direct excitation into the gold(II1) porphyrin subunit generates the corresponding triplet excited state which is unreactive toward energy- or electron - transfer processes. In contrast , excitation into the zinc(II) or free - base porphyrin produces the corresponding excited singlet state which transfers an electron to the adjacent ruthenium(II) bis(terpyridy1) complex. Secondary electron transfer to the appended gold(II1) porphyrin competes with reverse electron transfer such that the redox equivalents become separated by about 30 A. The original ground - state system is restored by relatively slow interporphyrin electron transfer. The energetics for each of these electron - transfer steps have been evaluated from electrochemical measurements and by measuring the rates as a function of temperature and solvent polarity. For the zinc(I1) porphyrin - containing triad , electron transfer takes place in the solid state at 77 K. Finally , the performance of the latter triad is compared with that of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center complex .","21, 22, 40, 41, 49, 50, 51, 52, 102, 103, 126, 127, 131, 132, 145, 146, 155, 156, 217, 218, 218, 219",,,,,,,,

Irradiation of l*Ac at 320 nm in a methyltetrahydrofuran ( MTHF ) matrix at 77 K yields a species with a lifetime of 10.1 ms and an emission spectrum containing the four vibrational bands charcteristic of acetophenone phosphorescence. In order to determine if triplet energy would be transferred through the skeleton of l*Ac , samples in which naphthalene was added to the MTHF matrix were irradiated. As the concentration of naphthalene in the MTHF matrix was increased , l*Ac phos- phorescence intensity decreased while naphthalene phospho- rescence was induced. Naphthalene phosphorescence was not seen upon direct irradiation of naphthalene , so triplet energy must be transferred through the skeleton of 1 in these experi- ments.

10.1021/ja00143a007-0,"Abstract : Construction of sulfones in enantiomerically pure form provides a great opportunity to enhance their value as synthetic building blocks. Allylic sulfones , in particular , have great flexibility derived from sulfone - controlled additions to the double bond. Two strategies have been developed based upon the ability to effect asymmetric allylic alkylations with palladium employing ligands derived from c2 symmetric diamines and 2-(dipheny1phosphino)- benzoic acid. Desymmetrization of meso-2-ene- 1 ,Cdiol diesters does not involve the nucleophile in the enantio- discriminating step and thus should , a priori , not depend upon the nature of the nucleophile. Indeed , such desymmetrization of such a diester in the presence of a sulfinate anion gave excellent enantioselectivity. On the other hand , conversion of both enantiomeric allylic esters to enantiomerically pure allylic sulfones requires sodium benzenesulfinate to participate in the enantiodiscriminating step. Five- , six- , and seven - membered substrates all gave excellent enantioselectivities. A catalytic phase transfer system proved most efficacious on larger scales. Propagating the asymmetry requires diastereoselective functionalization of the double bond. While epoxidation proved excellent for the five - membered ring case and satisfactory for the six - membered ring case , it was unsatisfactory in the seven - membered ring case. Osmium tetroxide - catalyzed cis-dihydroxylation gave excellent diastereoselectivities in the six- and seven - membered ring cases. Reductive cleavages produced enantiomerically pure allylic alcohols. Base - catalyzed elimination generated enantiomerically pure y-hydroxy-a,B-unsaturated sulfones from which further stereogenic centers were produced by diastereoselective conjugate additions.

Metal chelation may play an important role for the ring opening to take place in a disrotatory fashion ( Scheme 3 ) ; a metal chela- tion such as in C or D would force the ring opening to be in a thermally forbidden disrotatory mode to avoid the step- wise process from the oxaziridine anion A to the chelated anion E.

10.1021/ja0014739-0,"Abstract : Porous materials with immobilized metal complexes of defined structure have wide applications in catalysis , gas storage , and sensor technology. Reported herein is the use of template copolymerization methods to design and synthesize reversible dioxygen binding sites in a porous organic host. The immobilized metal sites are formed using molecular precursors including a substitutionally inert Co(III) complex that ensures the desired square - pyramidal coordination geometry around the immobilized metal ions. Analysis of the resulting mesoporous polymer by EPR spectroscopy reveals an equilibrium of four- and five - coordinate sites which is similar to that observed for molecular analogues in solution. This equilibrium is sensitive to the solvent used to suspend the polymer , with the highest percentage of five - coordinate sites ( 60 % ) observed in CH3NO2 , which is the same solvent used to synthesize the polymer. In the presence of dioxygen ( cid : 24)90 % of the immobilized sites convert to Co-O2 adducts. Dioxygen binding to the material is reversiblesrevision to the dioxygen - free form is obtained by purging with N2. The large percentage of sites involved in dioxygen binding can only occur if the spatial arrangement of ligands within the immobilized sites is maintained throughout the copolymerization process. This level of molecular control within the porous organic hosts illustrates the effectiveness of this method for developing metal complexes in solid supports .","37, 38, 58, 59, 79, 80, 115, 116, 132, 133, 148, 149, 160, 161, 162, 163, 171, 172, 188, 189",,,,,,,,

Thiol modification within base - pairing domains of oligonucleotides can be accomplished by the synthesis of DNA bases carrying protected thiol groups. In this vein , adenine , guanine , and cytosine bases modified in the hydrogen - bonding groups have been shown to form crosslinks in duplex DNA.2'*23 Thymines have also been modified in the hydrogen - bonding domain.22 Although such structural modi- fications are useful , they have the disadvantage that they can significantly destabilize helices by inhibiting normal Watson- Crick pairing of the DNA. An altemative approach was described in a recent report , in which a thymine base modified at the C-5 position carries a thiol at the end of an alkyl chain.24 That strategy has the advantage of not interfering directly with base pairing , although it may indirectly destabilize pairing , since C-5 saturated alkyl substitution of thymines is known to lower binding affinity in duplex DNA.28","20, 21, 28, 29, 36, 37, 44, 45, 56, 57, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 72, 73, 85, 86, 92, 93, 136, 137, 145, 146, 151, 152, 176, 177, 179, 180",,,,,,,,
